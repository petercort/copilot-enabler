# Copilot Enabler

![Visual Studio Marketplace Version](https://img.shields.io/visual-studio-marketplace/v/PeterCort.copilot-enabler?link=vscode%3A%2F%2FPeterCort.copilot-enabler)

**Analyze and improve your GitHub Copilot adoption.** Discover unused features, get actionable recommendations, and implement them interactively — all from within VS Code.

## ✨ Features

### 📊 Adoption Scorecard

Get an instant snapshot of your Copilot usage with an overall adoption score (0–100), feature detection counts, and log analysis — displayed in the **status bar**, a **webview dashboard**, and **sidebar tree views**.

### 🔍 Feature Catalog

Browse all **27 tracked Copilot features** organized across three categories:

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| **Core** | Ask Mode, Agent Mode, Plan Mode, Chat Panel, Subagent, Background Agents, Cloud Agents |
| **Tools** | Inline Completion, Quick Chat, Smart Actions, Multi-line Completes, Next Edit Suggestions (NES), Model Selection, Selection, Codebase, Problems, Web Search, Changes |
| **Customization** | Instructions, Prompt Files, Agent Skills, Custom Agents, MCP Servers, Hooks |

### 🏆 Prioritized Recommendations

Recommendations are ranked using an **Impact × Difficulty matrix** so the highest-value, lowest-effort items ("quick wins") surface first — each with a star rating (★★★ → ☆☆☆).

### 🤖 Interactive Implementation

Click **Implement** on any supported recommendation and Copilot Enabler opens a **Copilot Chat session** with a tailored prompt that:

1. Reads your project structure and context
2. Asks clarifying questions
3. Generates and writes the configuration files for you

Supported implementations include:
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — project-specific coding guidelines
- `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md` — reusable prompt templates
- Custom agents and agent skills
- `.vscode/mcp.json` — MCP server configuration
- `.github/hooks/prerun.json` — Pre-run and post-run hooks

### 🧪 Promptimizer — Prompt Context Analysis

Ingest agent prompt logs (Copilot Chat traces, Anthropic SDK JSONL dumps, or mitmproxy/Charles HAR captures) and see exactly where your context window is spent. Promptimizer classifies every block — system, custom instructions, skills, MCP tool schemas, messages, attachments — tokenizes each one, and flags stable prefixes that belong behind a prompt-caching breakpoint.

A rule engine emits concrete caching recommendations (R-C1 through R-C5) with `$ / 100 turns` estimates based on published Anthropic pricing. All analysis runs locally — nothing is uploaded.

See [docs/promptimizer.md](docs/promptimizer.md) for the full guide.

### 📝 Export Reports

Generate a full **Markdown adoption report** with scorecard, recommendations, and a feature adoption matrix — perfect for sharing with your team or tracking progress over time.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install** the extension from the VS Code Marketplace (or build from source).
2. **Open a workspace** — the extension activates automatically and runs a background scan.
3. **Check the status bar** — look for `$(pulse) Copilot: --/100` in the bottom-right corner.
4. **Run a full analysis** — open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`) and select:
   ```
   Copilot Enabler: Run Full Analysis
   ```
5. **Browse results** — explore the sidebar tree views, dashboard, and recommendations.
6. **Implement a recommendation** — click the 💡 icon on any implementable recommendation or run:
   ```
   Copilot Enabler: Implement Recommendation
   ```

> **Tip:** The extension also includes a **Getting Started walkthrough** — search "Maximize Your Copilot Usage" in the walkthroughs panel.

| **Extensions** | Installed extensions — Copilot Core, Copilot Chat, MCP-related, chat participants |
| **Copilot Logs** | VS Code Copilot log files scanned for feature usage hints (completions, modes, participants, etc.) |


### Analysis Agents

Three specialized agents evaluate different dimensions of Copilot adoption:

- **CoreAgent** — Are you using Ask, Agent, Plan, and other core modes?
- **CustomizationsAgent** — Have you set up instructions, prompts, MCP, skills, and hooks?
- **AdoptionAgent** — Full gap analysis across all 27 features with prioritized recommendations
